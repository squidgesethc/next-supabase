## Information

This is just a side project I am working on at the moment. If you want you can clone the project and set it up using your own supabase keys.


This project uses [`supabase`](https://supabase.com) and is hosted on [`vercel`](https://vercel.com).

You can find this site over [here](https://next-supabase-phi.vercel.app)



## Getting Started
This project uses bun, to install bun run
```bash
npm i -g bun
 ```

More info about [bun](https://bun.sh) can be found at their website

Once you have cloned the site run the command below
```bash
bun install
```
Then set up your environment variables in .env.local
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

You can find these out when creating a new project in supabase

It now should run like any other next app 

### tl:dr

1. Decide if you want to clone the project
2. Run git clone https://github.com/squidgesethc/next-supabase.git
3. Run bun install
4. Add your environment variables
5. You're good to go!
